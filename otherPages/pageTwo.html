                <div class="historyMainHead">So, wanting to know our history and how we came to be?</div>
                <div class="historySuppHead">We've been in business for 45 year and it all started with Mr.Auto Senior, my father</div>

                <div class="historyHeroDescr">With just a set of mistmatched tools and his home garage, he set out to start repairing and making a difference.</div>
            </div>
            <div class="historyDetailsContainer">
                <div class="historyDetailsTitle">From pouring drinks to rolling under cars.</div>
                <div class="historyDetailsSubTitle">1977</div>
                <div class="historyDetailsDescription">After a decade of bartending at the Bar's R Us (Owned by himself) my father noticed a pattern.  Sure there were always customers who complained about work, gas prices, etc.  Those were all normal things that every person has to deal with.  However, one issue was irregular.  Regulars would come in and mention how they felt ripped off getting their car fixed.  This stood out as Mr. Auto Sr. had always fixed his own car.  What would cost him $50 in parts, was costing others $500+.  Sure labor was something he didn't need to pay for, but that alone couldn't account for the huge difference.  He decided to take a look himself.</div>

                <div class="historyDetailsSubTitle">1978</div>
                <div class="historyDetailsDescription">Running the bar and working it meant it took him some time, but he did find out the issue in the end. Taking his car to 10 different mechanic shops for a quote on his brakes, he saw two problems.
                    <ol class="historyDetailsList">
                        <li>Shops would always try and tell him the problem was bigger than it was.  All he needed was a brake pad change, but they wanted to "repair" his pads, rotors, and sometimes even the bearing.</li>
                        <li>Shops marked up their parts to an insane degree.  A part that anyone could buy for $50, they were charging $200 (keep in mind that shops will always buy the parts for cheaper too, since they can buy them in bulk)</li>
                    </ol>
                    This bothered my old man, people were being ripped off by dishonesty and greed.  As a man of virtues, he couldn't allow that.  The reason he had a bar in the first place was to meet people and to give em a comfy place to air their troubles.  Now he saw another way that he could help.
                </div>

                <div class="historyDetailsSubTitle">1979</div>
                <div class="historyDetailsDescription">A side business at first, became the main business in less than a year.  Using funds from the bar, he kickstarted The Good Shop out of his garage.  In the bar and the local paper, he advertised that his shop would only fix what was needed and would never upcharge parts for more than what any person could buy them for. It was an instant success.Due to his policies in part, but also due to the trust he had built as a pillar of integrity in the community.  That same year he sold his bar and used the money to buy a true shop.</div>
                <div class="historyDetailsSubTitle">1982</div>
                <div class="historyDetailsDescription">With business booming as it was, it was all hands deck at the new The Good Shop.  But life threw a curveball with the news of Twins coming along.  During this time he would work from 6AM-8PM, and then work at home until 2am most nights, getting it ready for his first children.  When my mother gave birth to my sister and I, the shop was closed for the first day since it had open.  My father, never a person who cared for sterotypes, told me that he was set on teaching his twins the business and how to fix just about everything</div>
                <div class="historyDetailsSubTitle">1990</div>
                <div class="historyDetailsDescription">Having worked in the shop since we were 8, my sister and I "officially" joined the business.  To ensure there was no infighting, my father passed duel ownership to the both of us.  In the bilaws it states that we can't sell our share to anyone not directly decendent of either of us.  This was his way to ensure that greed stayed at bay. It was also to ensure that future customers would always be in good hands. (which they still are to this day).  Business was still booming, so with this new ownership, it was decided that a bigger shop was needed.  That is when we opened the 10 bay and put to rest the 2 bay shop that had treated us well.</div>
                <div class="historyDetailsSubTitle">2010</div>
                <div class="historyDetailsDescription">After our father saw that we could make it on our own, he retired in 2000. He would still always check in on the business and come help whenever it got too busy.  He did so even during his last few months.  Sadly, a legend was lost this year.  The greiving wasn't just over us though, it blanketed the entire town that he had helped become a center of commerce.  Us twins talked about what to do, and that's when we decided to honor him with the name change of the company.  "The Good Shop" would forever now be known as "Auto R Us". Both as a testament to his namesake, and to the business that had helped him launch this one.</div>
                <div class="historyDetailsSubTitle">Current Year</div>
                <div class="historyDetailsDescription">Not much has changed in the past decade or so.  My sister and I still run the shop together, and we still keep integrity as the core of our business module.  We have thought about opening another shop, but that will probably wait till her or my kids are of age to take a shop over.  Sure we could find a manager we trust to run one of them.  But given how well my fathers idea of keeping the business run by the family has gone, we aren't gonna go against that anytime soon.  If you have any issues that need fixed, feel free to come on down to the place were parts are cheap and the prices will shock you.  To the place that Auto built to help people.</div>
